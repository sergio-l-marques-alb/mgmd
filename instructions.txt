*** Verfy if the build_dir build_dir link has been created in this directory

* Create symbolic link to build_dir:
```sh
cd trunk
ln -s /home/olt_shared/oltosng/build_dir_"version" build_dir
```
*** Obs: when checking out a branch version, build_dir should be followed by its respective numbering. 
*** eg: for branch 4.16 the command becomes "ln -s /home/olt_shared/oltosng/build_dir_4.16 build_dir".
